UnClaude is a powerful **Agentic Coding Assistant** that runs entirely on your local machine. It connects to **any LLM provider** (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Ollama) to give you a fully autonomous, model-agnostic pair programmer.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🌟 Model Independence
Don't be locked into a single provider. UnClaude uses `LiteLLM` to support over 100+ models. Switch between cheap, fast models for planning and reasoning models for coding instantly.

### 🧠 Infinite Memory (The Brain)
UnClaude implements a local Vector Database (Chroma/LanceDB) to remember your project context, architecture decisions, and secrets across sessions. It doesn't just read files; it *remembers*.

### 🏗️ Ralph Wiggum Mode (Autonomous Engineer)
The `ralph` command launches a **Multi-Agent Swarm** designed for autonomy:
*   **Plans**: Creates a `TASK.md` blueprint before coding.
*   **Codes**: Implements complex multi-file projects.
*   **Verifies**: Runs tests/commands (`pytest`, `npm test`) in a TDD loop.
*   **Self-Heals**: If tests fail, it autonomously analyzes the error and fixes the code.

### 🌐 Browser Automation (The Eyes)
UnClaude includes native **Browser Integration** (via Playwright). It can:
*   Open URLs and verify web applications.
*   Click, type, and interact with UIs.
*   Take screenshots for visual verification.

### 🛠️ Full System Access (The Hands)
A true agent needs tools. UnClaude provides:
*   **File Operations**: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep.
*   **Terminal**: Execute Bash commands with permission handling.
*   **Web**: Search and Fetch capabilities.

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: pipx (Recommended)
Calculated to be the easiest way to run Python CLIs (like `npx`).
```bash
pipx install unclaude
# or run without installing
pipx run unclaude chat
```

### Option 2: pip (Standard)
```bash
pip install unclaude
```

### Option 3: Development (from source)
If you want to modify the code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unclaude.git
cd unclaude
pip install -e .
```
*(Note: You can use `uv pip` for faster installation, but standard `pip` works fine!)*

### Browser Support
To use the browser tool, you need the Playwright browsers:
```bash
playwright install chromium
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

UnClaude has a built-in onboarding flow.

```bash
# Run the interactive setup wizard
unclaude login
```

This will guide you through:
1.  Selecting your default LLM provider (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
2.  Entering your API Key (stored securely in `~/.unclaude/config.toml`).
3.  configuring optional settings.

**No environment variables required!** (Though they are still supported for CI/CD).

## 🎮 Usage

### 💬 Interactive Chat
Just talk to code.
```bash
unclaude chat
> "Refactor utils.py to use async/await."
```

### 🏎️ Create Projects (Ralph Mode)
Give it a job and a way to verify it.
```bash
# The "One Prompt Project"
unclaude ralph "Build a Snake Game in Python with a GUI" -f "python3 snake.py"
```

### 🧠 Managing Memory
UnClaude automatically indexes your conversation for future recall.
```bash
unclaude chat "Remember that the deployment port is 8080."
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

UnClaude uses a **Loop-based Agent Architecture**:

1.  **Orchestrator Agent**: Decides if a plan is needed.
2.  **Planner Agent**: Writes `TASK.md`.
3.  **Coder Agent**: Executes tool calls (Edit, Bash, Browser).
4.  **Feedback Loop**: Parses `ToolResult`, `Bash Exit Codes`, and `Memory Retrieval`.
